/*
The Idea is pretty simple as we know that range of numbers is from 1 to N-1 
so we loop through element at each index and compare it i.e element at 0th index should be 1,at 1st Index 2 and so on.....
So when we find a number which does not match this means element of that index is missing;

  public:
    int MissingNumber(vector<int>& array, int n) {
        // Your code goes here
        sort(array.begin(),array.end());
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(i == array[i-1]){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                return i;
