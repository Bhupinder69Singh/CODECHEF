/*LOGIC
here to rotate the array we used mod it helps to find the exact index of current pointed element
in the array.
eg: if we have a array{1,5,6,7,8} here its size is 5(no of elements) 
if n is size then indexes are from 0 to n-1 range
we are given k=2 i.e position by which each element is rotated forward
when (i+k) is moded with size of array exact position is obtained
8=n-1
7=n-2
6=n-3
5=n-4
1=n-5
if i=3 ie 7 then as k=2 then shift will be n-1..n
