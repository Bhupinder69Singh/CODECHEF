/*
here the idea behind to solve this problem is 1) we start scanning all the elements in the array
2) then we are given that all integers in the array are not greter than length of the array
3)so we scan that element and move to the absolute value of that index-1 
eg:-[4,1,2,5,4,6] 
when we scan 4 we will move to index 1 less than 4 i.e 3
4)Then we will negate that value value present at that index that is at index 3 we will have value present 5 so we make it
-5 
5)we repeat this process ,when we find again 4 in array we repeat the same and then value at that index becomes -(-5)=5
as the value became positive we know it came twice
6)hence it will be our answer value
